## 1. Two Sum
 Given an array of integers nums and an integer target.
 Return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
 You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
```go
func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
        n := len(nums)
	// Check the first element to the second last.
	for i := 0; i < n-1; i++ { // faster than for _,i:= range(nums)
		// Check from the next element to the last element
		for j := i + 1; j < n; j++ {
			if nums[i]+nums[j] == target {
				return []int{i, j}
			}
		}
	}
	return []int{}
}
```

## 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

```go
121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.
-212 -> 212- is not 
10 -> 01 is not
```

```go
func isPalindrome(x int) bool {
    // When x < 0, x is not a palindrome
    // Also if the last digit of the number is 0, in order to be a palindrome,
    // the first digit of the number also needs to be 0.
    // Only 0 satisfy this property.

    if x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0) {
        return false
    }
	
  revertedNumber := 0;
  for x > revertedNumber {
	  revertedNumber = revertedNumber * 10 + x % 10
	  x /= 10
  }
  // We don't need to revert all the number and compare with the original one.
  // We can cut the number in half and compare  
  // When the length is an odd number
  // we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
  // For example when the input is 12321
  // at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
  // since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome
  // (it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
  return x == revertedNumber || x == revertedNumber/10;
}
```
