## Background
I was a Data Engineer working on AWS in Vietnam before. But a lot of things happen, and now I want to change my career to Software Engineer after coming to Germany.

I am currently studying Master in Digital Health at Hasso Plattner Institute, Go Programming Language, and Google Cloud Platform.
