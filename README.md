# üè† Hieu Le's personal blog

This is the place I keep notes of what I learnt and what I accomplished. This blog is also about my journey to achieve my dream.


## Why

* Explore the Go language by writing tests
* **Get a grounding with TDD**. Go is a good language for learning TDD because it is a simple language to learn and testing is built-in
* Be confident that you'll be able to start writing robust, well-tested systems in Go
* [Watch a video, or read about why unit testing and TDD is important](why.md)
