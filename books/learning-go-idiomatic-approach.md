# ðŸ“” Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming

## Primitive Types and Declarations

### Literals

**Integer literals** are normally base ten, but different
prefixes are used to indicate other bases: `0b` for binary (base two), `0o` or leading 0 with no letter follow for octal (base
eight), or `0x` for hexadecimal (base sixteen). 

**Rune literals** represent characters and are surrounded by single quotes. In Go, Single quotes and double quotes 
are **not interchangeable**. Rune literals can be written as single Unicode characters `'a'`, 
8-bit octal numbers `'\141'`, 8-bit hexadecimal numbers `'\x61'`, etc.

A **byte** is an alias for **uint8**. Note: **Uint8** value range is **0 to 255** and **int8** range is **-128 to 127**
(-128: 10000000 (1 is a sign bit), 127: 01111111).

An **int** (or **unit**). On a 32-bit or 64-bit CPU, `int` is a 32-bit or 64-bit signed integer like
an int32 or int64.

**Float**: float32 and float64. While Go lets you use `==` and `!=` to compare floats, donâ€™t do it.
Instead, define a maximum allowed variance and see if the difference 
between two floats is less than that.

**Strings** in Go are immutable; you can reassign the value of a string variable, but you
cannot change the value of the string that is assigned to it.

The **rune** type is an alias for the **int32** type.

### var Versus :=

```go
var x int = 10
var x = 10
var x int
x:= 10
```

Situations within functions where you should avoid `:=`:
* When initializing a variable to its zero value, use `var x int`. This makes it clear
  that the zero value is intended.
* specify
  the type of the value: `x := byte(20)`, it is idiomatic to write
  `var x byte = 20`

### Typed and Untyped Constants
Constants can be typed or untyped. 
All of the following assignments are legal:

````go
const x = 10
var y float = x
var z byte = x
````

### Naming Variables and Constants

The names `k` and `v` (short for key and value) are used as
the variable names in a `for-range` loop, standard for loop: `i` and `j`
are common names for the index variable. People will use the first
letter of a type (for example, `i` for integers, `f` for floats, `b` for
booleans).

## Composite Types

### Arrays

```go
var x = [12]int{1, 5: 4, 6, 10: 100, 15}
```

This creates an array of 12 ints with the following values: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0,
100, 15]. `5: 4` means 0 0 0 0 to index 5, then 4.


### Slices


One slice is appended onto another by using the `â€¦` operator to expand the source slice
into individual values.

```go
y := []int{20, 30, 40}
x = append(x, y...)
```


When a slice grows via append, the Go runtime usually increases a slice
by more than one each time it runs out of capacity. The rules as of Go 1.14 are to
double the size of the slice when the capacity is less than 1,024 and then grow by at
least 25% afterward.

### Declaring slices

```go
var data []int // a slice that stays nil
var x = []int{} // empty slice zero-length, non-nil
data := []int{2, 4, 6, 8} // slice with default values
x := make([]int, 0, 5)
```

If you have a good idea of how large your slice needs to be, use `make` with a zero length and a specified capacity. 

Append can make overlapping slices. The full slice expression includes a third part, which
indicates the last position in the parent sliceâ€™s capacity thatâ€™s available for the subslice.

```go
y := x[:2:2]
z := x[2:4:4]
```
