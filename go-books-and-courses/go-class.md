This post includes information that I found interesting or important while watching the YouTube Go Tutorial Series:
**Go Class** by **Matt KØDV**

## 0. Intro and Why Use Go?

* Simple and readable language that makes SE easier: When read our past code or hire new people.
* Concurrency for new generation of multicore processor.
* Integration with the Cloud: Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, GCP.

For me, I think the newer, the better.
